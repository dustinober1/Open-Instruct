## Brief overview
Project-specific guidelines for version control workflow.

## Version control workflow
- Always commit and push changes immediately after each code change
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why
- Ensure the repository is in a clean state with all changes pushed before considering a task complete
